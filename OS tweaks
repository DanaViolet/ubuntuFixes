#this will contain a log of all ubuntu issues, and how they were resolved.
#first line in each set will contain a description of the issue.
#subsequent lines will contain steps taken to resolve the issue.
#if any variables need to be changed, the value that they are changed to will also be included.

#experiencing high number of memory swaps.
#researched zram/zswap
#found a great article: https://askubuntu.com/questions/471912/zram-vs-zswap-vs-zcache-ultimate-guide-when-to-use-which-one
#discovered these features were merged into the main kernel years ago
#zram is good if you have no swap file. I have a swap file, so i need zswap
found zswap files in: /sys/module/zswap/parameters
"enabled" file contains the value N
#going to change it to Y
#tried these instructions: https://ubuntu-mate.community/t/enable-zswap-to-increase-performance/11302
#those instructions failed. pluma couldn't open the file
used nano to open /etc/defaults/grub
added "zswap.enabled=1 zswap.compressor=lz4" inside the line "GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="
updated grub
enabled lz4
restarted pc.
success.
